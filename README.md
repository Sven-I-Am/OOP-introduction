# An introduction to OOP with PHP
#### exercise in week 7 (01/11/2021 - 05/11/2021) of my BeCode training
## why?
in order to get a deeper understanding of Object Oriented Programming, classes, methods and properties, our coaches at [BeCode](https://github.com/becodeorg/ANT-Lamarr-5.34/tree/main/2.The-Hill/php/oop-introduction) provided us with an introductory set of exercises.

## what I learned from this?

Having the exercises build on eachother helped me better understand the use of private/public/protected/static keywords.  
This set of exercises is a great way to introduce codersto the concept of Object Oriented Programming (with PHP in this case).
