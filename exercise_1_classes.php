/* EXERCISE 1
Create a class beverage.
Create the properties color (string), price (float) and temperature (string) and also foresee a construct.
Have a default value "cold" in the construct for temperature.
Remember for now we will use properties and methods that can be accessed from everywhere.
Make a getInfo function which returns "This beverage is <temperature> and <color>."
Instantiate an object which represents cola. Make sure that the color is set to black, the price equals 2 euro and the temperature to cold automatically
 print the getInfo on the screen.
print the temperature on the screen.
USE TYPEHINTING EVERYWHERE!
